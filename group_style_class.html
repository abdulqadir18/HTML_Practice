    Let’s start with the defined benefit (DB) pension system. Think of this as the public pension funds set up to aid all Indian government employees. The workers did not contribute to the pension fund. But the employer i.e. the government did chip in. They even managed the fund for the employees. And upon retirement, the workers were promised a guaranteed income for life based on things like pre-retirement salary and years of services.

    This was how pensions were administered for a long time. And back in the day, even private sector companies like Godrej, Marico, and Tata Tea deployed this model.

    If you have a company promising to pay employees a fixed pension for decades, then they have to back up that promise. But what happens when you invest in a fund that does poorly? The company then will have to make up the difference. And if you’re strapped for cash, it can become a massive problem. Also projecting long term payouts and calculating long term liabilities can be extremely complicated.

    Take the Indian government for instance. It stopped defined-benefit plans for its new employees in 2004. And introduced the National Pension System (NPS) — with the hybrid model of sorts. Equal parts contribution from the employee and equal parts contribution from the employer.
