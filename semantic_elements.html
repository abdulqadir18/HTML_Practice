        <p>
          For the uninitiated, here’s a brief about cartels and the competition commission of India — “Cartels crop up when all the big players come together and collectively make decisions that benefit the group. They aren’t good for consumers. They tame competition and discourage innovation in products. Moreover, when cartels dominate a market, consumers don’t get the benefits of price discounts. So, we have elaborate checks and balances in place to make sure cartels don’t ruin our lives and we’ve delegated this sacred task to the Competition Commission of India (CCI). These good people are tasked with regulating companies that indulge in anti-competitive behaviour.”
